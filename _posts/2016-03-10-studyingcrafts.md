The [Crafts Council][commissioner] is Britain's national agency for contemporary craftsmanship, presenting craft in new ways and challenging perceptions of what it is and what it can be. The Studying Crafts reports focusses specifically on the aspects of education within the field.

Due to the fact our application was not in any way isolated from the rest of the Crafts Council website, the development required both a restrained approach to what libraries we could use and constant communication with the client's own technical team. The resulting product used mostly vanilla javascript, with the scrolling controlled by fullPage.js and animations handled by GSAP.
