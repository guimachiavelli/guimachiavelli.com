# The Greenbee (2013)

Between 2012-2013 [David Kulen][collab1] and I collaborated on redesigning [The Greenbee][link-site] for [enbiun][collab2]. The Greenbee is a dutch site that facilitates communication and transactions between farmers and consumers. David acted mainly as an art director, while I designed and coded the blunt of the pages.

We also collaborated on the MeatYourOwn hotsite, which is a seal attributed to farmers that adhere to standards of sustainability and cruelty-free livestock.

I worked only as a front-end developer on this project, relying heavily on jquery and the google maps api, plus SASS, compass and susy. The back-end was developed in python/Django by [Wouter Hassing][collab3].
