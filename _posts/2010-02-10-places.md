# Fantastic Places (2010)

Series of digital finger paintings on the iPad. This series focus on inexistent places and their inhabitants. All in all, the opposite of observation drawing.

I also made a small process video of one of the drawings:

There are a few more and [larger versions on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/guimachiavelli/sets/72157627462839713/). Yes, I still use it. And I still like it.
