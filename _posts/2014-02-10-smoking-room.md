# The Smoking Room (2014)

[link-site][The Smoking Room] was created with [link-collab][Pinar&Viola] for the “This is the ENDD: The E-Cigarette in Context”, a conference organised by [commissioner][Rhizome] at the New Museum to discuss the political and social impact of e-cigarettes.

I was responsible for handling the technical aspects, both server- and client-side. Besides the subject matter, my main interests were to get acquainted with varied areas, from fluid dynamics (for the smoke generation), face recognition (to add the cigarette to the avatar’s mouth) to real-time chat.

Though the room is admittedly empty since the end of the conference, it is still accessible and fully functional at [https://thesmokingroom.net][link-site] using the latest versions of Opera, Chrome and Firefox. 

Code available on [Github][git].
