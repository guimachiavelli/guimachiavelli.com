# I Will (2011)

I created [I Will][link-site], a site that corrupts the avatars of twitter users who say "I Will", as a conceptual exploration on how one's wishes affect one's future.

[![]({% image_path iwill/iwill3.jpg %})][link-site]

This was created for Werkplaats Typografie and ISIA Urbino's summerschol. Our assignment was to create a project around the idea of time; we also had a jolly good time there.

[![]({% image_path iwill/iwill7.jpg %})][link-site]

The whole thing was made in PHP (based on open-sourced code from [Recyclism][reference1]) plus the usual front-end stuff ([Github link][git]).
