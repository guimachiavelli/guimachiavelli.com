# Song of the apocalypse (2016)

Song of the Apocalypse was the result of a workshop on publishing and destruction initiated by [Hackers and Designers][commissioner1] in partnership with the [Sandberg Institute][commissioner2].

Taking the bible at its face value as the word of god, and following the christian belief that the universe was created by the words of god (e.g. "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."), I decided to destroy the world by destroying the word of god. As each letter disappears, we hear its dying breath in the form of a sine wave with a frequency equal to the letter's ASCII value, punctuated by the verse numeration.
